# Real-Time-Domain-Adaptation-in-Image-Segmentation
This repository includes the full code and the paper of the project for the final exam of "Machine learning and Deep learning" course @ Politecnico di Torino

## Code
The code contains:

Markup : 1.An implementation of a real-time semantic segmentation network, BiSeNet (Bilateral Segmentation Network), that can exploit two different backbones, ResNet-101 or ResNet-18;
